I had problems with the web analyzer not showing me all revisions.
Therefore, I picked a date range, for which I was sure, that Seerene included the complete list of revisions online.

Time range used for the compilation of the top 10 source code files with respect to the number of changes:
**17.04.2019 - 15.05.2019**
