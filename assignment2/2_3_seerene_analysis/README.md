# Comment to results

As discussed in
[Moodle Topic: Nur Daten fr√ºher als Mai in Map sichtbar](https://moodle.hpi3d.de/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1755),
I had problems with the web analyzer not showing me all revisions.
Therefore, I picked a date range, for which I was sure, that Seerene included the complete list of revisions online.

Time range used for the compilation of the top 10 source code files with respect to the number of changes:
**17.04.2019 - 15.05.2019**

As discussed in another [Moodle Thread: Mismatch Map & Liste](https://moodle.hpi3d.de/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1764),
the map and exported list view have different results, so I picked the top 10 files (according to code changes) from
the exported spreadsheet document instead of the map view (the explained workaround didn't worked for me).
